# Simple retail scrappers

A simple scrapper for Amazon.fr and Darty (french websites). built with ***python*** and ***BeautifulSoup4*** (BS4). It binds with google sheets using ***gspread*** to get the links and output the results. 

Note: it is probably best to use Amazon's API to get pricing information, especially since they restricted access to scrappers.
